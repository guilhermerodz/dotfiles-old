# Personal Dotfiles Management

Note: look at the branch name before applying this to your O.S.

## Requirements

- `git`
- `bash` (comes by default in most systems)

## Replication

**Run the following command to replicate these dotfiles on your machine:**
```sh
curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guilhermerodz/dotfiles/mac_os/install-dotfiles.sh | /bin/bash
```

This management approach wasn't created by me. [Durdn previously made a post about it](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).
