# Personal Dotfiles Management

Run `curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guilhermerodz/dotfiles/mac_os/install-dotfiles.sh | /bin/bash` to replicate these dotfiles on your machine.

This management approach wasn't created by me. [Durdn previously made a post about it](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).
